% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%\boldmath
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models are used to detect dementia in MRI scans. Each scan is segmented and then normalized into four discrete color areas corresponding to white matter, dark gray matter, light gray matter and black background, the former three constituting the feature set. Thresholding technique is used in segmentation and nearest neighbor interpolation technique is used in normalization of the images. The ANN implementation resulted into 69.81\% accuracy and the KNN implementation resulted into 81.13\% accuracy in classification of demented and non-demented scans.

\section{Introduction}
Dementia is a broad category of neuro-degenerative diseases, including, but not limited to, Alzheimer \textquotesingle s Disease, that causes a long term and often gradual decline in the patient\textquotesingle s ability to think and remember [1]. 
\par Dementia is a leading cause of deaths today; it affects more than 44 million people worldwide with every 1 out of 20 patients under the age of 65. The global cost of caring for dementia is estimated to be \$605 billion, which is equivalent to 1\% of the global gross domestic product [1].
\par Diagnosis of dementia is conventionally done through cognitive, neurological and neuropsychological evaluation of a patient\textquotesingle s mental state. These tests, however, can not provide tangible measure of severity and proper indication of the suitable treatment [2].
\par Neuroimaging in dementing illness has undergone revolutionary changes in recent years with the wide availability of an unprecedented array of new techniques. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), in particular, has aided in objective analysis for determining the presence and subsequently the type of dementia. Radiological findings may support the diagnosis of specific neurodegenerative disorders and sometimes radiological findings are necessary to confirm the diagnosis. It is a challenge for neuroimaging to contribute to the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\textquotesingle s disease. Early diagnosis includes recognition of pre-dementia conditions, such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) [3].
\par Timely diagnosis of Dementia is vital in developing early treatments and designing management strategies to this fatal disease, but only 1 in every 4 people with Alzheimer\textquotesingle s or related dementia have been properly diagnosed [1]. This raises a need for easy and non-invasive technique for dementia diagnosis.
\par Previous researches in this field have used naive Bayesian classifier [4], [5]; C4.5 decision tree[4], [6], [8]; Support Vector Machine (SVM)[5], [7]; Neural Network[7] and multi-modality classification framework [9]. These have resulted in average accuracy of around 80\%. 
\par This project uses Artificial Neural Network and K-Nearest Neighbor approaches to classify MR Images into demented and non-demented categories.
\section{Data}
This project uses a dataset containing 436 neurological MRI scans made available by the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) project. This data set consists of a cross-sectional collection of 416 subjects covering the adult life span aged 18 to 96 including individuals with early to mild to moderate Alzheimer\textquotesingle s Disease. For each subject, 3 or 4 individual T1-weighted MRI scans obtained within a single imaging session are included. Each scan includes age, sex, education level, socioeconomic status, intracranial volume, and normalized brain volume, and two indicators of dementia: the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and Minimental State Exam (MMSE) associated with additional information about the subject. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2.05in]{5.jpg}
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
\caption{Original Image Slice}
\end{figure}
\par All images are in 16bit Bigendian Analyze 7.5 format. Each scan consists of 3D images of dimension 176x208x176 voxels which have been preprocessed to remove the skull, leaving only brain matter in the images [10]. 
\par The available data is divided into 12 discs with a total of 235 datasets containing enough information about Dementia. Undemented MRI scans have Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) value 0. Demented MRI scans have Clinical Dementia Rating(CDR) value of 0.5, 1, 1.5 or 2 depending on the severity of dementia.
\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Image Preprocessing}
Image files of the MRI scans from OASIS consists of raw information about each voxel. This image cannot be used directly to model a image classification system since this image consists of large number of features and analysis of such features increases the complexity in modeling a classifier. So, image preprocessing should be performed in order to reduce some unnecessary features and preserve others that bear significance in dementia detection. Image preprocessing includes format conversion, image re-sampling, grayscale color enhancement, noise removal, segmentation, image normalization and finally feature extraction.\newline
\subsubsection{Segmentation}
Thresholding technique is used for segmentation of 3D images into four different volumes which are image background, white matter or the cerebro-spinal volume of the brain, the dark gray matter or the tissues inside the brain and the light gray matter (intermediate tissues between Gray matter and Cerebro-Spinal Fluid, CSF).
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2.05in]{9.jpg}
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
\caption{Segmented Image Slice}
\end{figure}
\newline The grayscale values and representative values of each of the volumes are:
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	Particulars & Grayscale Value & Representative Value\\
	\hline
	Background & 0-5 & 0\\
	Dark Gray Matter &  5-38 & 85\\
	Light Gray Matter  & 38-72 & 170\\
	White Matter & 72-255 & 255\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Range of Grayscale values for Image Segmentation}
\end{table}
\newline
\subsubsection{Normalization}
7 layers from the top and 25 layers from the bottom of the image were removed as they contain only black voxels, which is an irrelevant information to our cause. The 3D image size is hence reduced from 176 X 208 X 176 to 144 X 208 X 176.
Nearest neighbour interpolation was then performed. Nearest-neighbor interpolation (also known as proximal interpolation or point sampling) is a simple method of multivariate interpolation in one or more dimensions. It has been used in approximating the grayscale value of a non-given point in some space when given the value of that function in points neighboring that point. The nearest neighbor algorithm yields a piecewise-constant interpolant. This process is repeated four times to reduce image data to 9 X 13 X 11, with a total of 1287 voxels.
\subsection{Feature Extraction}
From the above normalized image data, three volumes: dark gray matter, light gray matter and white matter, are considered. These values are measured from normalized segmented brain volume. Total volume of the matters is 398. These extracted volumes are hence normalized into the range 0 to 1 by dividing each value by 398. Thus the features for the machine learning model are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Normalized volume of Dark gray matter (Tissues)
	\item Normalized volume of White matter (CSF)
	\item Normalized volume of Light gray matter (Intermediate tissues between Gray matter and CSF)
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2.2in]{Features.png}
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
\caption{Extracted Features}
\end{figure}
\subsection{ANN Implementation}
A neural network is modeled with a three neuron input layer, each corresponding to one of the extracted features. This model consists of two hidden layers and an output layer with two neurons each. The hidden layers use hyperbolic tangent function as activation function, mathematically expressed as:
\begin{equation}
f(x) = tanh(x) = \frac{2}{1+e^{-2x}} - 1 
\end{equation}
The model uses back propagation method for training.

\subsection{KNN Implementation}
A KNN model is designed where the 5-fold cross validation technique resulted in 7 as the best value of K (value of K for minimum classification error). So, the majority class of the 7 nearest neighbors of each input scan is assigned as the class for that scan. 
\par Nearest neighbor approximation is done by the measure of Eucledian Distance as given by:
\begin{equation}
\delta = \sqrt{ (G_{ip}-G_{tr})^2 +(g_{ip}-g_{tr})^2 +(W_{ip}-W_{tr})^2}
\end{equation}
Where,
\newline $\delta$ = Eucledian Distance
\newline $W_{ip}$ = Normalized volume of white matter of input image
\newline $g_{ip}$ = Normalized volume of light gray matter of input image
\newline $G_{ip}$ = Normalized volume of dark gray matter of input image
\newline $W_{tr}$ = Normalized volume of white matter of training image
\newline $g_{tr}$ = Normalized volume of light gray matter of training image
\newline $G_{tr}$ = Normalized volume of dark gray matter of training image

\par Out of the 53 test data, the ANN model resulted in 18 true positives and 19 true negatives along with 9 false positives and 7 false negatives. This means that the ANN model is able to identify positive dementia with a Positive Prediction Value (PPV) of 0.6666 and negative dementia with a Negative Prediction Value (NPV) of 0.7307.

\par Out of the 53 test data, the KNN model resulted in 19 true positives and 24 true negatives along with 4 false positives and 6 false negative. This means that the KNN model is able to identify positive dementia with a Positive Prediction Value (PPV) of 0.8260 and negative dementia with a Negative Prediction Value (NPV) of 0.80.
\section{Conclusion}
From the above result, we can see that the KNN model has performed better than ANN model in all statistical measures of performance of binary classification models.
\par The KNN model produces adequate accuracy to be termed as a medically acceptable level of diagnosis accuracy($>$80\%) for the dataset used. This level of accuracy as given by the KNN model is better in comparison to many existing systems and within comparable bounds of several others.
\par Machine learning and artificial intelligence can produce significant accuracy in classification of demented and non-demented MRI scans. Further, artificial intelligence, if researched extensively, may some day surpass human accuracies in disease diagnosis and replace human expertise in the same.

\section{Future Work}
The OASIS repository provides limited datasets that can be used in KNN implementation and in training the ANN model. A larger dataset covering a wide range of subjects could improve the accuracies of these models and in verification of the results obtained. 
\par Further experimentation on the ANN could result into a better model for implementation in Dementia diagnosis.
\par Also the use of filters like median filter and fuzzy filter could reduce noise in the image leading to better accuracy.

% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the

% used instead of \subfloat.
