Reactive Power Compensation is an
important and indispensable aspect in power system. Most of the loads
are inductive in nature and consume reactive
power. Hence, the distribution system behaves
as the sink of reactive power. When the large
amount of lagging current flows through the
system, the system voltage goes down. In such
situation, VAR compensator brings the voltage
back to normal value. STATCOM is a FACTS
device based on VSI topology, which generally
provides superior performance characteristics
compared
to
conventional
compensation methods employing TSCs and
TCRs. STATCOM can both supply and consume
reactive power. When the system needs
reactive power, it acts as a source and supplies
reactive power but when there is excess of
reactive power in the system, it acts as a sink
and consumes reactive power. This paper
presents MATLAB simulation of three phase
STATCOM. A STATCOM with the Hysteresis
Band Current Control is developed in
MATLAB/Simulink
to
observe
their
performance.

	\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{S}{TATCOM} is a switching converter type static
VAR generator, which generates or absorbs
reactive power through several switching pattern
within its converter without the use of any capacitor or
inductor banks.

\bigskip

Conventionally, capacitor banks are used to
compensate the reactive power since capacitor
draws a leading current. Power electronics
devices are gaining wide popularity nowadays for improving the
performance of transmission and distribution
systems. The reactive power compensation and
control have been recognized as efficient and
economic means of increasing power system
transmission capability and stability. The FACTS
devices, such as STATCOM has been introduced
more recently which employs VSI topology with a fixed
DC link capacitor as a static replacement of the
synchronous condenser.

\bigskip
Functionally, the operation of the STATCOM is
similar to that of an ideal synchronous
condenser which can generate or absorb the
reactive power by varying the excitation in the
field winding. In case of STATCOM, the change in
gate signal is analogous to the change in
excitation of condenser because it causes the
change in terminal voltage of STATCOM as in the
case of condenser terminal voltage. The reactive
power in any line always flows from higher
voltage magnitude to lower voltage magnitude.
	

\section{Problem Specification}

Voltage
control
and
reactive
power
management are the two aspects of a single
activity that both supports reliability and
facilitates commercial transactions across
transmission networks. In real practice, most of
the loads are inductive in nature which consume
reactive power. That means, a large amount of
lagging current drawn by the load results in
voltage sag. At low voltages, electrical
equipments perform poorly. For example: light bulb provides less illumination, and induction
motor will not operate efficiently and in some
case it may not start at all. Reactive power flow
from the generation side to the distribution side
increases transmission line losses and reduces
the power transmission capability of the transmission line. So, we use so many FACTS
controller devices to control the flow of reactive
power. Since STATCOM provides a fast response
and flexible solution to this problem, STATCOM
is the most widely use VAR compensator. 



	\section{System Description}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
%\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.7in]{1}
\caption{STATCOM System}
\label{f1}
\end{figure}

This system includes voltage source inverter, hysteresis band controller and dc link capacitor.
The voltage source inverter consists of three
pairs of IGBTs (Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistor). Each pair consists of two IGBTs
which are switched in complementary fashion. If
the top device is on then the bottom device is off
and vice versa. Hysteresis
band controller
provides the switching signals to the IGBT by
making the actual current follow the reference
signal within the limited hysteresis band.

\bigskip
This system is designed in such a way that when
the load changes resulting the change in reactive
power, the voltage also changes (voltage
increases or decreases), it is sensed by the
voltage sensor which is compared with the reference voltage and generates an error signal
which when passed through PI controller
produces reference quadrature axis current ($I_q$).
Similarly, dc link capacitor voltage is compared
with the value of voltage that we desire it to be
constant and generates an error signal which is
fed to the PI controller. It produces reference direct
axis current ($I_d$). The reference direct and
quadrature axis currents when passed through
Parkâ€™s transformation (dq to abc transform)
produces reference abc phase currents. The
hysteresis band controller compares the actual
current through the STATCOM branch with the
reference currents which produces gating signal
corresponding to each leg of IGBT (one gating
signal can control both the IGBT of the same leg
since the top and bottom IGBTs are switched in complementary fashion) by comparing the
actual current of the inverter sensed by the
current sensor with upper and lower limits of
hysteresis band. This gating signal controls the
magnitude and phase of the output of the
inverter so that the inverter produces the
reactive current which compensates the reactive current drawn by the load and maintains the
voltage at load terminal. The phase is required to
compensate for the active power losses that
occur in the inverter and transformer so that the
voltage across the capacitor is maintained
constant.

\section{MATLAB Simulation}
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{2}
\caption{STATCOM model}
\label{f2}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{3}
\caption{STATCOM Subsystem}
\label{f3}
\end{figure}
$I_d$ calculation subsystem gives the active
component of current that should flow through
STATCOM. This block consists of a closed loop
control system with PI controller to maintain the
voltage across the dc link capacitor at reference
value. It controls the phase angle output of
STATCOM voltage. The active power loss in the
STATCOM branch should be supplied by the
source.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{4}
\caption{$I_d$ calculation subsystem}
\label{f4}
\end{figure}

If the active power through the
STATCOM branch is greater than the active
power loss, the excess of reactive power charges
the capacitor and the capacitor voltage
increases. Similarly, if the active power through
the STATCOM branch is less than the active
power loss, the deficient active power is supplied
by capacitor and the capacitor voltage
decreases. So, to maintain the value of dc link capacitor at constant value, this PI control loop
is designed. Thus, designed PI control loop will
generate the respective control signal to
maintain the capacitor voltage constant.
The reactive power demanded by the load
should be supplied by the STATCOM branch,
which is the main aim of our system.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{5}
\caption{$I_q$ calculation subsystem}
\label{f5}
\end{figure}
 $I_q$ calculation block gives the reactive component
of current that should be supplied by the
STATCOM branch. This block consists of the
closed loop control system which compares with
the power supplied by the STATCOM with the
reactive power of the load. The error thus
obtained is passed through PI controller which
will generate the control signal to generate $I_q$
and compensate the reactive power.

\section{HBCC}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{6}
\caption{HBCC}
\label{f6}
\end{figure}

This is the hysteresis band current control block. This
block generates the gating signals for the
inverter. In this subsystem, the reference
currents and the actual signals through the
STATCOM branch are subtracted and passed
through a relay block. The relay switches its state
when the difference tries to go beyond the two
limiting values and the gating signals are
generated. The gate signals thus obtained will
control the switching of the IGBT and thus make
the actual current within the hysteresis band.

\section{dq to abc transformation}


In our system dq0 to abc transformation
generates the reference signals for the
STATCOM currents. dqo to abc transformation is
also known as Inverse Parks Transformation.

This model consists of three phase voltage
source with the rating of 400V connected to
three phase RL load of 1000 watts and 1000 VAR.
Extra inductive load of 5000 VAR is added after
0.4sec. The STATCOM is switched on after
0.8sec.

\bigskip
The simulation results shown in the fig shows
that initially the system is running at 0.953pu.
When extra reactive load of 5000Var is switched
on after 0.4 sec, the system voltage drops to
0.771pu. The STATCOM is switched on at 0.8sec,
and after few cycles of transients, the STATCOM
action increases the system voltage and it is
maintained between 0.99 pu and 1.002 pu. From
the plot of Qsource, Qload and Qstat, we can see
that initially the source is supplying the reactive
power before the STATCOM is switched on and
after the switching of STATCOM, the source is relieved of supplying the reactive power as the
reactive power for the load is supplied by the
STATCOM. Hence the above observation
suggests that STATCOM is supplying the reactive
power to the load and maintain the system
voltage at rated value.

\bigskip
In our STATCOM model there are two closed
loops. One loop maintains the voltage across the
dc link of the capacitor and the other loop
maintains the reactive power injected by the
STATCOM. Here, the reference voltage for the dc
link is 600 V and the plot of Vdc shows that the
voltage across the dc link of the capacitor is
maintained at 600V. From the plot of $I_{stat}$, we
can see that the current through the STATCOM
branch is following the reference current and the
actual current is within the 5\% of the reference
current. The output voltage of the STATCOM is
not sinusoidal and is shown in the figure.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper Simulation of STATCOM in
MATLAB/SIMULINK with different reactive
power load has been studied. The strategy works
well for reactive power compensation. For
different value of the load our STATCOM branch
is generating required amount of reactive
power. Also if load is capacitive our system is
capable to draw that excess amount of reactive
power too. Also performance of STATCOM with
various control technique for VSI has been
discussed here; PI control technique has been
suggested for voltage and reactive power
injection followed by the hysteresis band current
controller. The hysteresis band current controller is
used to control the STATCOM current. The STATCOM is found to be efficient technology compared to the conventional methods of reactive power compensation.
