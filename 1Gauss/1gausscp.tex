\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
In this article, a method of finding number of lattice points within a real-circle having center at origin has been mentioned, which in-fact is the requirement of Gauss Circle Problem. The method involves a simple concept of analytical geometry, basic algebra and number theory.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} problem was proposed by one of the great mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. Simply stated, the problem is all about counting number of points with integer coordinates which are inside a circle of given radius centered at the origin. The solution to this problem was mentioned in Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen 1999.[1] In this article the alternative way to attain same result is mentioned.
 \subsection{Lattice point in $R^{2}$}
A point $(x,y)$ in $R^{2}$ is said to be a lattice point if $x \in Z$ and $y \in Z$.




\section{Problem Statement}
Consider a circle in $\textbf{R}^{2}$ with equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}$, $a \geq 0$, how many ordered pairs $(m,n)$ exist, such that $m,n \in Z$ and $m^{2}+n^{2} \leq a^{2}?$ [2]
\section{Solution}
We divide the problem into two cases and provide a solution for both.
\subsection{Case 1: $a \in Z$}
First we consider the line $y=a$ as a reference line. The only reason behind this assumption is that it is used as the reference to count the lattice points. The lines horizontal to $x$-axis, $y=a-1, y=a-2,....,y=0$ are defined as the $1^{st}, 2^{nd},....., a^{th}$ \textbf{integral line} respectively. Clearly, the shortest distance between $k^{th}$ integral line and reference line is $k.$ While the vertical lines are represented by equation $x=b, b \in R$. However, our interest is limited within lines $x=i,i \leq a,i \in Z^{+}$. The reason being that, we first count the lattice points on first quadrant and no line $x=i,i > a$ intersect the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}$.
\\\\ Clearly, the line $x=i, i \leq a, i \in Z^{+}$ cuts the line $y=a$ at point $(i,a)$ and the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}$ at point $(i, \sqrt{a^{2}-i^{2}})$. Let $d_{i}$ be the distance between these two points, then clearly $d_{i} = a- \sqrt{a^{2}-i^{2}}$.
\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{It shows that lattice point lies outside circle if $d_{i}>k$.}

\end{figure}
\\\\ Let $(i,a-k)$ be any point on $k^{th}$ integral line, $y=a-k$. Then, clearly the point $(i, a-k)$ lies within the circle if, $d_{i} \leq k$. (i.e., $a- \sqrt{a^{2}-i^{2}} \leq k$ ). Refer figure $(1)$ and $(2)$.

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{It shows that lattice point lies within the circle if $d_{i}<k$.}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{diag1}
\end{figure}
Let $i_{k}$ be the maximum value of $i, i \in Z^{+}$ that satisfies the inequality $a- \sqrt{a^{2}-i^{2}} \leq k$, then all the lattice points $(i,a-k), i \in Z^{+}, i \leq i_{k}$ lie within the circle. Hence $i_{k}$ number of lattice points lie on the $k^{th}$ integral line and the section of the circle within the first quadrant. And the points are $(1,a-k), (2,a-k),......, (i_{k},a-k)$. If we include the lattice point on $k^{th}$ integral line lying on y-axis, then one more point $(0,a-k)$ is added and hence the number becomes $(i_{k}+1)$.
\\\\Let $i_{1},i_{2},i_{3},.....,i_{a}$ be the largest integers ($i$) that satisfy inequality $a- \sqrt{a^{2}-i^{2}} \leq k, k=1,2,3,.....,a$ respectively. Then the $1^{st},2^{nd},.....,a^{th}$ integral lines contain $(i_{1}+1),(i_{2}+1),(i_{3}+1),.....,(i_{a}+1)$ points within the circle and in the first quadrant including axes. Since $a \in Z$ , the point $(0,a)$ itself is a lattice point satisfying the condition of Gauss Circle problem but does not lie on any integral line. Hence if $S$ be the total number of lattice points in the first quadrant (including axes) and within the circle then,$$ S=1+ \sum_{k=1}^{a} (i_{k}+1)$$.
\\Since, $a\in Z,$ both positive $x-$axis and positive $y-$axis include $'a'$ number of lattice points excluding origin. Hence the number of lattice points in first quadrant (excluding axes) and within the circle is, $N= (S-2a-1)$.
\\\\So, if $N(a)$ be the total number of lattice points within the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}$, $a \geq 0$ then,
$N(a)=4(S-2a-1)+4a+1 = 4((S-1)-a)+1$.
Hence, $$N(a)=4\bigg\{\sum_{k=1}^{a}(i_{k}+1)-a\bigg\}+1$$.
\subsection{Case 2: $a \notin Z$}
Then we replace $a$ by $[a]$ and the reference line will be $y=[a]$, where $[a]$ is the largest integer that is less than or equal to $a$. In case $(1),$ reference line contained only one lattice point, while in case $(2)$ more than one lattice point may exist. So we need to add a correction factor.
\\\\
Let $y=[a]$ and the circle intersect at point, $(h,[a]),h \in R$ in first quadrant. Then $[h]$ number of lattice points lie on the reference line intercepted in first quadrant (excluding axes). So, from the symmetry of the circle, $4[h]$ lattice points are added.
\\\\Hence, first choosing reference line as $y=[a],$ we evaluate the number of lattice points within the circle using steps in case $(1).$ Let $n(a)$ be the total lattice points obtained by the result. Then we evaluate $[h].$ Hence actual lattice points $N(a)$ can be evaluated using, $$N(a)=n(a)+4[h].$$



\section{Illustration}
Let the equation of circle be $x^{2}+y^{2}=3^{2}$,
\\Since the radius of circle$(a)$ is 3, it contains 3 integral lines. For first integral line, $k=1$, and let $i_{1}$ be the largest integer that satisfies inequality $a- \sqrt{a^{2}-i^{2}} \leq k$. Then, $3- \sqrt{3^{2}-i_{1}^{2}} \leq 1 \Rightarrow i_{1}^{2} \leq 5 $. The largest integer that satisfies the given inequality is 2. So, $i_{1}=2$.
\\Also, for second integral line, $k=2$, and let $i_{2}$ be the largest integer that satisfies inequality $a- \sqrt{a^{2}-i^{2}} \leq k$. Then, $3- \sqrt{3^{2}-i_{2}^{2}} \leq 2 \Rightarrow i_{2}^{2} \leq 8 $. The largest integer that satisfies the given inequality is 2. So, $i_{2}=2$.
\\Also, for third integral line, $k=3$, and let $i_{3}$ be the largest integer that satisfies inequality $a- \sqrt{a^{2}-i^{3}} \leq 3$. Then, $3- \sqrt{3^{2}-i_{3}^{2}} \leq 3 \Rightarrow i_{3}^{2} \leq 9 $. The largest integer that satisfies the given inequality is 3. So, $i_{3}=3$.
\\\\Now using, $$N(a)=4\bigg\{\sum_{k=1}^{a}(i_{k}+1)-3\bigg\}+1$$
$$N(3)=4\bigg\{\sum_{k=1}^{3}(i_{k}+1)-a\bigg\}+1$$
$$N(2)=4(i_{1}+1+i_{2}+1+i_{3}+1-3)+1= 29.$$
Hence for the circle of equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=3^{2}$, $29$ ordered pairs $(m,n)$ exist, such that $m,n \in Z$ and $m^{2}+n^{2} \leq 3^{2}$.

\section{Advancement}
The problem seems to be simple yet its solution becomes tedious for the higher values of radius.
Therefore, many mathematicians have tried to relate the number of lattice points in a circle with its area. If $R$ is the radius of the circle and $N(R)$ be the number of lattice points in the circle then we write, $N(R) = \pi R^{2} + E(R)$, where $E(R)$ is some error term. 
\\Gauss managed to prove that $|E(R)| \leq 2\sqrt{2}\pi r.$

\section{Application}
It is a problem from the field of pure mathematics. This problem is important because it gives an idea of representing any integer as a sum of two squares. 
\\The results of this problem are applicable in the field of harmonic analysis, basic lattice point analysis and uncertainty principle. [3]
